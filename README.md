# Feeding-Entrainment
Related to the control of Arduino-controlled feeding access of *Drosophila* using a 3D printed food well with a sliding physical barrier

#### 3D Design
Contains the SOLIDWORKS files for the actual physical device used to regulate food acccess while recording *Drosophila* locomotor behavior using a Drosophila Activity Monitor

#### BareMinimum
Minimum code necessary for the Arduino to work, used to hold the system in stasis during prototyping

#### FeedEntrainv1.0
Script to control multiple stepper motors independently or simultaneoulsy via an Arduino microcontroller

#### TimeandAccelExperiment
Playtime script for testing out different settings on stepper motors for increased torque, distance traveled for alignment of physical berrier, etc.
